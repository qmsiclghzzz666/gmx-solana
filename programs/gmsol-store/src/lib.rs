//! # The GMX-Solana Store Program
//!
//! The Store Program defines several fundamental accounts that form the core of its functionality:
//!
//! - [`Store`](states::Store): A central account that serves as a global configuration store and
//!   permission manager. It acts as the authority ("owner") for other program accounts and manages
//!   role-based access control. The global [GT](#gt-model) state is also stored in this account.
//! - [`TokenMap`](states::TokenMap): A mapping of token configurations and price feed configurations
//!   that defines supported tokens and their associated price oracle feeds.
//! - [`Market`](states::Market): A market account that stores market-specific configurations and
//!   maintains the global market state.
//! - [`Position`](states::Position): Tracks a user's active position in a market.
//! - Basic Market Action accounts: Accounts that track user actions and positions in markets
//!   - [`Deposit`](states::Deposit): Tracks a user's pending deposit request into a market.
//!   - [`Withdrawal`](states::Withdrawal): Tracks a user's pending withdrawal request from a market.
//!   - [`Shift`](states::Shift): Tracks a user's pending request to shift from one kind of market token to another.
//!   - [`Order`](states::Order): Tracks a user's pending order request in a market, including swap orders and increase/decrease position orders.
//! - GLV (GMX Liquidity Vault) Action accounts: Accounts that track user interactions with GLV tokens.
//!   - [`GlvDeposit`](states::GlvDeposit): Tracks a user's pending deposit of tokens into a GLV pool to mint GLV tokens.
//!   - [`GlvWithdrawal`](states::GlvWithdrawal): Tracks a user's pending withdrawal of tokens from a GLV pool to burn GLV tokens and withdraw the underlying tokens.
//!   - [`GlvShift`](states::GlvShift): Tracks a keeper's pending request to rebalance tokens between different market pools within the GLV pool.
//! - User accounts (see [`UserHeader`](states::UserHeader) for details): Tracks user information including the GT and esGT balances of the user, referral code, and referral relationships.
//!
//! The instructions for the store program are categorized into the following sections:
//!
//! ## Store
//!
//! A [`Store`](states::Store) Account serves as both an authority and a global configuration
//! storage.
//!
//! A store and its associated accounts form a *deployment*. Each deployment operates independently,
//! allowing multiple instances of the protocol to coexist on-chain (only available when the
//! `multi-store` feature is enabled).
//!
//! #### Instructions for Store Accounts
//! - [`initialize`](gmsol_store::initialize): Create a new [`Store`](states::Store) account.
//! - [`transfer_store_authority`]: Transfer the authority of the given store to a new authority.
//! - [`transfer_receiver`](gmsol_store::transfer_receiver): Set the claimable fee receiver address.
//! - [`set_token_map`]: Set the token map account to use.
//!
//! #### Instructions for Config Management
//! - [`insert_amount`]: Insert an amount to the global config.
//! - [`insert_factor`]: Insert a factor to the global config.
//! - [`insert_address`]: Insert an address to the global config.
//! - [`insert_order_fee_discount_for_referred_user`]:
//!   Insert order fee discount for referred user factor to the global config.
//!
//! #### Instructions for Feature Management
//! - [`toggle_feature`]: Enable or disable the given feature.
//!
//! ## Role-based Permission Management
//!
//! The role-based permission system for each GMSOL deployment is managed through its
//! [`Store`](states::Store) Account. The permission structure consists of:
//!
//! - **Administrator Role**: A single administrator address stored in the `authority` field of the
//!   [`Store`](states::Store) Account. This address has exclusive rights to modify the permission table
//!   and use other administrative instructions.
//!
//! - **Custom Roles**: A flexible role system stored in the `role` field as a [`RoleStore`](states::RoleStore)
//!   structure. This allows for granular permission management through custom roles and role assignments.
//!   Each role can be assigned to multiple addresses.
//!
//! #### Instructions for Permission Management
//! - [`check_admin`](gmsol_store::check_admin): Check whether *the signer* is the admin of the given store.

//! - [`has_role`](gmsol_store::has_role): Return whether the given address has the given role in the given store.

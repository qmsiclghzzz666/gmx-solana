- programs: Cancelled the ADL execution fee refund to ensure the fairness of ADL.
- programs: Set `GlvShift::MIN_EXECUTION_LAMPORTS` to `0`.
- programs: The `transfer_referral_code` instruction only update the `next_owner` field of the referral code.
- sdk: Changed to use `Gateway::fetch_signatures_multi` to fetch price signatures for Switchboard pull oracle implementation.
